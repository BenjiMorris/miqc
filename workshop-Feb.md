# Workshop - February 17th 2026

# Mathematical and Physical underpinnings of Topological Quantum Computation at Leeds 2026

Organisers: Eric Rowell (Texas A&M and Leeds), Ben Morris (Leeds), Paul Martin (Leeds) 


In February we will have a critical mass of visitors visiting Leeds to conduct research on the above topic. This workshop simply
