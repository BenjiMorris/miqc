# Workshop - February 17th 2026

# Mathematical and Physical underpinnings of Topological Quantum Computation at Leeds 2026

Organisers: Eric Rowell (Texas A&M and Leeds), Ben Morris (Leeds), Paul Martin (Leeds) 


In February we will have a critical mass of visitors visiting Leeds to conduct research on the above topic. This workshop simply 
collects the informal talks of our visitors (and a few connecting locals) into a coherent day of research discussion. 
All those interested are welcome to attend. (All coordinates and details will be announced closer to the time.)
